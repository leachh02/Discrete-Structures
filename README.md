## Code:

bork.py - A solution that traverses and outlines a complicated map, inspired by a text-based adventure game. The solution was created by utilising mathematical concepts such as set theory and applying it to a programmable implementation.

problem_solving.py - Two mini projects that incorporate the mathematical topics of Finite State Automata (regex) & Linear Algebra and are implemented via Python.

(supplementary files have been included, including a pdf report for both the project and problem solving solutions)
