## Code:
bork.py - A solution that traverses and outlines a complicated map, inspired by a text-based adventure game. The solution was created by utilising mathematical concepts such as set theory and applying it to a programmable implementation.

problem_solving.py - Two mini projects that incorporate the mathematical topics of Finite State Automata (regex) & Linear Algebra and are implemented via Python.

(Supplementary files have been included, including a pdf report for both the project and problem-solving solutions. The supplementary code is not my own work but rather the QUT organization's, however, it is required for my files to be run)
